# Lowendinsight GitHub Action
This is an action for Lowendinsight, a simple "bus-factor" risk analysis library for Open Source Software which is managed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). In its current state, this action works against both NPM and Mix based projects, currently existing in the develop branch of Lowendinsight. When run against a GitHub repository, a `.json` file will be generated of the format `lei--Y-m-d--H-M-S.json` and pushed to that repository's root directory by default.

## Usage
```yaml
name: LEI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
      with:
        persist-credentials: false # otherwise, the token used is the GITHUB_TOKEN, instead of your personal token
        fetch-depth: 0 # otherwise, you will fail to push refs to dest repo

      uses: gtri/lowendinsight@gha
      with:
